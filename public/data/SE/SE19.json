They noted that the trees have not been maintained for many years, and this lack of upkeep now poses a significant risk to the property?s foundations, particularly given that this Victorian house is built on clay soil. Please see the extract from the report below: There are a number of very large trees within proximity of the subject property. These are of major concern to the foundational aspects and will almost certainly be affecting the foundational aspects of the subject property. As such, we are seeking approval to reduce the crown size of Trees 1?11 as shown on the attached plan. We are requesting permission for a crown reduction of 30% for each tree. The trees are identified on the plan as follows: 1. Leylandi Cypress 2. Ash 3. Ash 4. Horse Chestnut 5. Holm Oak 6. Horse Chestnut 7. Sycamore 8. Sycamore 9. Lime 10. Laurel Bay 11. Silver Birch For tree 10 (the Laurel bay tree), this has become overgrown and is positioned very close to the property.
