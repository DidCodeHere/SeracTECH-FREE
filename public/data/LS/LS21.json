[{"id":"Change of use of public house into 6 apartments with amenity space and external alterations including new windows and doors - NON MATERIAL AMENDMENT to 23/04667/FU - Amendments to the approved parking layout to allow ease of access into the developed flats from the parking area. The parking will feature a strip of paving to the head of the bays that will allow for circulation from the vehicles to the building. The electric chargers will be repositioned atop the existing stone wall to the head of the bays to allow for simpler electrical cabling to the chargers and easier access to chargers for users. 6 metres has been retained to the rear of the bays to allow for access in and out when reversing. The scheme is also very simple in terms of alterations. The parking layout has been flipped to mirror the existing parking layout and offer better access.","desc":"","addr":"Former Yeoman Public House Gay Lane Otley LS21 3BB","postcode":"LS21 3BB","link":"https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=T7DBBXJBM4R00&activeTab=summary","status":"Unknown","date_received":"2025-12-29","lat":53.903058,"lng":-1.6907},{"id":"Permission in principle for demolition of former Otley Clinic and erection of 8No. residential dwellings","desc":"","addr":"Otley Clinic Manor Square Otley LS21 3AY","postcode":"LS21 3AY","link":"https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=T75GYAJB0C000&activeTab=summary","status":"Unknown","date_received":"2025-12-29","lat":53.906816,"lng":-1.694843},{"id":"Variation of conditions 2 (approved plans),3, (cycle and motorcycle parking), 7(remediation strategy) and 10 (surface water drainage) to previously approved planning application 21/03450/FU (Change of use of disused barns to 3 dwellings; alterations including; roof lights, bi folding doors, insertion of windows and doors) to amend the wording of the conditions to remove the pre commencement aspects of the respective conditions and to include additional drawings to form part of the approved plans relating to these conditions","desc":"","addr":"Grange Farm Black Hill Road Arthington Otley LS21 1PY","postcode":"LS21 1PY","link":"https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=T706Z2JBK7300&activeTab=summary","status":"Unknown","date_received":"2025-12-29","lat":53.885895,"lng":-1.587405},{"id":"Consent, agreement or approval required by condition 15 (Surface Water Scheme) of Planning Application 24/03220/OT","desc":"","addr":"7 Prince Henry Road Otley LS21 2BE","postcode":"LS21 2BE","link":"https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=T6SMPEJBGMC00&activeTab=summary","status":"Unknown","date_received":"2025-12-29","lat":53.913138,"lng":-1.692696},{"id":"Detached outbuilding to rear","desc":"","addr":"7 Silver Mill Cottages Otley LS21 3BL","postcode":"LS21 3BL","link":"https://publicaccess.leeds.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=T6FO3TJBL8Z00&activeTab=summary","status":"Unknown","date_received":"2025-12-29","lat":53.899545,"lng":-1.684289},{"id":"T1 Previously Pollarded small Sycamore to the rear of the property: Crown reduce on all aspects by 3m to leave a tree of 3m with a crown spread of 2.5m.
